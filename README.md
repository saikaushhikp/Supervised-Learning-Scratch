# Supervised-Learning-Scratch

This repository showcases a hands-on implementation of fundamental machine learning algorithms in pure Python. These implementations were developed as part of the "Foundations of Machine Learning" course taught by [Prof. Sri Rama Murty Kodukula](https://sites.google.com/iith.ac.in/ksrm/home). Rewriting these algorithms line-by-line helped solidify my understanding of their internal mechanics—no black boxes, just straightforward logic and well-documented code.

## Included Algorithms

The repo currently includes minimal, from-the-ground-up versions of several core algorithms, such as:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- Fisher’s Discriminant Analysis (FDA)
- Perceptron Learning Algorithm
- Predictive Distribution Methods
- Expectation-Maximization (EM) for Gaussian Mixture Models
- Basic Neural Networks (with support for dropout, early stopping, and regularization)
- Adam Optimization Algorithm
